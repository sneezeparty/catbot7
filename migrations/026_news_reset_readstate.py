"""Reset everyone's news read-state for the data-driven /news cutover.

News moved from a hardcoded `news_list` (20 upstream-era articles) to
`config/news.json`, which starts empty. `user.news_state` is a positional
string ("0"=unread per article index). Old rows hold length-20 states for the
*old* articles; left as-is they would suppress the "unread news!" banner for
the new article set (the check is `len(news) > len(news_state)`).

This wipes news_state to '' for every user so the first article you publish
via the webui News editor correctly shows as unread for everyone.

Idempotent via the 026.done marker. Bot MUST be stopped before running. Run
with the same env vars as bot.py:

    TOKEN=... psql_password=... python migrations/026_news_reset_readstate.py
